# Module 1: Challenge-1

## Description

This challenge fixes starter code to make a website more accessible to the user. We refactor the code to put in proper formatting and add comments which helps other developers collaborate. In the HTML file, we mainly change the div tags to more specific tags. In the CSS file, we mainly condense redundant code.

## Installation

Follow the URLs in the dropbox.

## Usage

To use the website, type the URL to the browser's search. You can click on the navigation bar to skip to the three sections.
